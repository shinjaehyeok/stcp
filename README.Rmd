# stcp: Sequential Test and Change-Point detection algorithms based on E-values / E-detectors

<!-- badges: end -->

stcp is an R package built to run nonparametric sequential tests and
online change point detection algorithms in [SRR 21'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08082) and [SRR 23'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03532). 
This package supports APIs of nonparametric sequential test and online
change-point detection for streams of univariate sub-Gaussian, binary, 
and bounded random variables. This package also provides APIs for general 
E-value based sequential test and E-detectors based change-point detection
frameworks for advanced users. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of stcp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shinjaehyeok/stcp")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.  -->
<!-- TODO Write vignettes for CP and other families-->
<!-- TODO Implement asymptotic CS via sub-G CS with sample variance-->
