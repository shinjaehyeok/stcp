Description: An implementation of sequential tests and online change point
  detection algorithms presented in SRR 21' and SRR 22'. This package supports 
  APIs of nonparametric sequential test and online change-point detection for 
  streams of univariate sub-Gaussian, binary, and bounded random variables. 
  This package also provides APIs of general E-value based sequential test and
  E-detectors based change-point detection frameworks for advanced users.
