# stcp: Sequential Test and Change-Point detection algorithms based on E-values / E-detectors

stcp is an R package built to run nonparametric sequential tests and
online change point detection algorithms in [CITE SRR 21' and SRR 22']. 
This package supports APIs of nonparametric sequential test and online
change-point detection for streams of univariate sub-Gaussian, binary, 
and bounded random variables. This package also provides APIs of general 
E-value based sequential test and E-detectors based change-point detection
frameworks for advanced users. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of stcp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shinjaehyeok/stcp")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.  -->
<!-- TODO 1. Make test also work for list; 2. To make CI works for variance process-->
